##Feature1
I was able to add an icon to the title of the page

I also added functionality to the navbar dropdown menu through JS

I added more html pages to be edited later

##Feature2
I began adding content to each page individually

Created a dummy Forum, Login and Submit page (Hopefully I can get these to work soon)

Added a sign up page
