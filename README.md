# TheBeatBlock
## Feature1
I was able to add an icon to the title of the page

I also added functionality to the navbar dropdown menu through JS

I added more html pages to be edited later

## Feature2
I began adding content to each page individually

Created a dummy Forum, Login and Submit page (Hopefully I can get these to work soon)

Added a sign up page

Switched the forum page to blog page (Because forums are confusing!)

Edited content

## Feature3
I was able to create my ejs routes and troubleshoot how they function. To my knowledge, all the file paths are functioning properly. The next step for me is to make my forms function properly in the next feature branch.

I have most of the dependencies installed but I have to wait to require them until the time is right.

## Feature4
I was able to add sign in and log out functionality. The next step is to try to add mp3s to the database to populate the music page. 

Upon my first deployment to heroku, I realized the home page beat block image was too large to render so I used software to reduce its file size along with the sizes of other images.
